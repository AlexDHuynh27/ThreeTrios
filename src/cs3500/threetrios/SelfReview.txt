We wish that we had changed the way my view updated, instead of doing repaint we should have had
an update method like our providers did, to update everything easily in one place. I think also,
instead of CardColor we should have taken in a Color that is part of a java library, to make it
easier for displaying graphics. One last thing we should have changed was having the
ReadOnlyThreeTriosModel be taken in for the view and no actual implementation of
ReadOnlyThreeTriosModel, as ThreeTriosGameModel is already a ReadOnlyThreeTriosModel.

The providers were very fast to respond and answered any questions we had. We emailed back
and forth a bit, and they were very coherent and kind.
The experience of adapting our model to their model though, was a little tedious as they had a lot
of interfaces for the different components, which made what we had for hands, grids, and decks need
an adapter as well. There were also some methods that weren't used in the view or the controller
we had made, making them obsolete.

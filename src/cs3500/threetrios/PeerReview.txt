Design Critique:
Overall, the provider's code was easy to understand as the model, view, and controller were all well
seperated and did not depend heavily on one another. Additionally, the providers were very detailed
with their model and view ensuring  that each component of the game was seperated into its own
interface or enum. One thing that could have been better was using an interface for Move class as it
should be in an interface with ThreeTriosMove implementing this interface. This would make the code
much cleaner and easier to work with.
